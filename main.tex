	\chapter*{Dedication}

	This thesis is dedicated with deep appreciation to those closest to me, whose support was indispensable in writing these pages and undertaking this journey.

	My academic path took me through studies in German and Italian, then to a major in Information Science with a focus on Media Informatics, culminating in a Master’s degree from Regensburg. A three-year doctoral stint in Computer Science at Erlangen followed, after which I shifted my focus to theoretical mathematics. Throughout, I grappled with whether I was truly satisfied with my choices, always drawn to the underlying structures of language and computing. It is with joy that I reflect on these discoveries.

	I am grateful to my mother, Beata, who, despite initial reservations, supported my decisions wholeheartedly once they were made.

	A special thanks to my late father, Domenico, who taught me to value the past more than the future.

	Thanks also to my sister, Dominique, who never ceased to engage me in discussions about physics whenever she had the chance.

	To Luciana, who brought joy and laughter back into my life during challenging times.

	And to all those unnamed, if these words strike a chord, you have touched my life in significant ways.

	I have learned much from each of you.

	\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

	I extend heartfelt thanks to Prof. Dr. Catherine Meusburger, who not only teached me the rigors of the Bachelor's program in Mathematics but also illuminated the more complex concepts of Linear Algebra I and II. Her invaluable assistance during our early sessions, where we dissected exercise sheets in the study room, was crucial. I am particularly grateful for the moments she joined us after a refreshing cup of coffee, skillfully translating challenging problems into clear solutions on the blackboard with swift strokes of chalk. 

My special gratitude is due to my supervisor, Prof. Dr. Kang Li. His readiness to engage in discussions was a beacon of motivation, especially when I was lost in the dense forest of scientific papers and theorems. Prof. Li's adeptness in distilling sprawling research into manageable segments for my bachelor's thesis was invaluable, and his excellent guidance has been a cornerstone of my still early academic journey in Mathematics.

Last but not least, I owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to my friends - Luciana Diaconescu, Phillip Gäbelein, Marie-Louise Isenberg, Sarah Wiesend, Adrian Hieber, Moritz Lanz, Sebastian Müller, Anton Hoof, Anton Rechenauer, and Constantin Winkler. Their companionship sweetened my days, their support was unwavering, and their presence essential to my achievements. Wherever they may find themselves now, I wish them every success and hope they know I am always here for them.
