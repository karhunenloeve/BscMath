	\chapter*{Dedication}

	I would like to dedicate this work to the people closest to me, without whom I
	would not have been able to write these pages, without whom I would not have
	been able to embark on this trip, without whom I would not have had the desire
	to continue on this journey.

	My path led me to study German with a minor in Italian, to major in
	Information Science with a minor in Media Informatics and finally to a Master's
	degree in Information Science in Regensburg. After a three-year doctorate in the
	field of Computer Science in Erlangen, I finally decided not to continue with
	my dissertation but to devote myself to studying theoretical mathematics. I was
	asked whether I could make up my mind and whether I was finally satisfied with
	what I was doing. To be honest, I was always interested in the structure of,
	well, basically elements. That just translated into language or computer
	programs. I'm glad I was able to discover that for myself.

	I would like to thank my mother Beata, who was always skeptical about these
	decisions, but always supported them once they were made.

	I would like to thank my late father Domenico, who always encouraged me to
	think more about yesterday and less about tomorrow.

	I would like to thank my sister Dominique, who never missed an opportunity to ask
	me questions about physics whenever she could.

	I would like to thank Luciana, who always brought back my old laughter in
	difficult times.

	I would also like to thank all those whom I cannot mention by name. If you feel
	touched by reading these lines, then I'm sure they affect you in one way or
	another.

	Perhaps I have learned a lesson or two from you.

	\chapter*{Declaration}

	I hereby declare that I

	\begin{itemize}
		\item alone wrote the submitted Bachelor's thesis without illicit or improper
			assistance.

		\item did not use any materials other than those listed in the bibliography and
			that all passages taken from these sources in part or in full have been marked
			as citations and their sources cited individually in the thesis. Citations
			include the version (edition and year of publication), the volume and page
			numbers of the cited work.

		\item have not submitted this Bachelor's thesis to another institution and that
			it has never been used for other purposes or to fulfill other requirements,
			in part or in full.

	\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

	I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Catherine Meusburger, who has taken over my
	mentorship for the Master's program in Mathematics and whose foundation
	lectures in Linear Algebra I and II were invaluable. I would also like to thank
	her for her help during the introductory lectures, when we rummaged through
	the exercise sheets in the study room and she occasionally took a look over
	our shoulders after a cup of coffee and then decorated the blackboard with
	helpful approaches or even complete solutions with a piece of chalk.

	My special thanks go to my supervisor, Prof. Dr. Kang Li. Prof. Li always motivated
	me with his willingness to discuss when I had already invested too much time in
	reading the scientific papers and lacked a clear view in the forest of theorems.
	Often also when there were tricky passages in the research literature whose
	evidence first had to be deciphered. Prof. Li also took the time to reduce the
	sprawling content to an appropriate level for a bachelor's thesis. I would like
	to thank him for his excellent supervision.
