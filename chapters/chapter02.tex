\section{Topological Spaces and Groups}

\subsection{Simplicial Complexes}
\label{simplicialcomplexes} We would like to emphasize that a collection of points
$X = \{x_{0}, x_{1}, \ldots, x_{d}\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is considered to be affinely
independent if these points do not lie within any affine subspace of dimension lower
than $d$.

\begin{definition}
	{($d$-Simplex) \cite[ยง2.1]{boissonnat2018geometric}} \label{d-simplex} Given a
	set $X = \{x_{0}, x_{1}, \ldots, x_{d}\} \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$ consisting of
	$d+1$ affinely independent points, the $d$-dimensional simplex $\sigma^{(d)}$,
	also known as a $d$-simplex, is defined as the set of all convex combinations
	of these points.
	\begin{equation}
		\sigma^{(d)}:= \left\{\sum_{i=0}^{d}\lambda_{i} x_{i} \; \vert \; \sum_{i=0}^{d}
		\lambda_{i} = 1, \; \lambda_{i} \geq 0 \right\}.
	\end{equation}
\end{definition}

As a convention, the empty set $\emptyset$ is included as a face, representing
the simplex formed by the empty subset of vertices. A $0$-simplex represents a single
point, a $1$-simplex represents a line segment connecting two points, a $2$-simplex
represents a triangle, and a $3$-simplex represents a tetrahedron. It is worth mentioning
that the $d$-simplex is homeomorphic to the $d$-dimensional disk $D^{d}$.

\begin{theorem}
	The $d$-simplex $\sigma^{(d)}$ is homeomorphic to the $d$-dimensional disk $D^{d}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	Define the standard $d$-simplex $\sigma^{(d)}$ as
	\[
		\sigma^{(d)}= \left\{(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{d+1}) \in \mathbb{R}^{d+1}\mid \sum_{i=1}
		^{d+1}x_{i} = 1, x_{i} \geq 0 \right\}
	\]
	and the $d$-dimensional disk $D^{d}$ as
	\[
		D^{d} = \left\{(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{d}) \in \mathbb{R}^{d} \mid \sum_{i=1}^{d}
		x_{i}^{2} \leq 1\right\}.
	\]

	We construct a homeomorphism $f: \sigma^{(d)}\rightarrow D^{d}$ by
	\[
		f(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{d+1}) = (\sqrt{x_{1}}, \ldots, \sqrt{x_{d}}),
	\]
	where $x_{d+1}= 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{d} x_{i}$. This map is well-defined since $\sum
	_{i=1}^{d} (\sqrt{x_{i}})^{2} = \sum_{i=1}^{d} x_{i} \leq 1$.

	The inverse $g: D^{d} \rightarrow \sigma^{(d)}$ is given by
	\[
		g(y_{1}, \ldots, y_{d}) = (y_{1}^{2}, \ldots, y_{d}^{2}, 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{d} y
		_{i}^{2}),
	\]
	ensuring that $g$ is well-defined because $\sum_{i=1}^{d} y_{i}^{2} \leq 1$ implies
	$1 - \sum_{i=1}^{d} y_{i}^{2} \geq 0$.

	Both $f$ and $g$ are continuous and inverses of each other as shown by $f(g(y))
	= y$ for all $y \in D^{d}$ and $g(f(x)) = x$ for all $x \in \sigma^{(d)}$.
\end{proof}

Furthermore, it is worth noting that $\sigma^{(d)}$ represents the convex hull
of the points $X$, which can be defined as the smallest convex subset of $\mathbb{R}
^{n}$ that contains all the points $x_{0}, x_{1}, \ldots, x_{d}$. The faces of
the simplex $\sigma^{(d)}$ with vertex set $X$ are simplices formed by subsets
of $X$. An $d$-face of a simplex refers to a subset of the vertices of the simplex
with a cardinality of $d+1$. The faces of a $d$-simplex with a dimension less
than $d$ are known as its proper faces. Two simplices are considered to be properly
situated if their intersection is either empty or a face of both simplices. By
identifying simplices along entire faces, we can construct the resulting simplicial
complexes.

\begin{definition}
	{(Simplicial Complex) \cite[ยง2.2]{boissonnat2018geometric}} \label{simplicialcomplex}
	A simplicial complex $K$ is a finite collection of simplices that satisfies the
	following properties:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item For every simplex $\sigma^{(d)}$ in $K$ and every face $\tau^{(k)}$ with
			$k < d$ of $\sigma^{(d)}$, it follows that $\tau^{(k)}$ is also in $K$.

		\item If $\sigma^{(d)}$ and $\tau^{(k)}$ are both simplices in $K$, then
			they are properly situated.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

The dimension of $K$ is defined as the highest dimension among its simplices. For
a simplicial complex $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, its underlying space
$\vert K \vert$ is the union of all the simplices in $K$. The topology of $K$ is
determined by the topology induced on $\vert K \vert$ by the standard topology in
$\mathbb{R}^{n}$. It is important to note that when the vertex set is known, a simplicial
complex in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ can be fully characterized by listing its simplices.
As a result, we can describe it purely in terms of combinatorics using abstract simplicial
complexes.

\begin{definition}
	{(Abstract Simplicial Complex) \cite[ยง2.3]{boissonnat2018geometric}} \label{abstractsimplicialcomplex}
	Consider a finite set $V = \{v_{1}, \ldots, v_{n}\}$. An abstract simplicial
	complex $\tilde{K}$ with vertex set $V$ is a collection of finite subsets of
	$V$ that satisfies the following two conditions:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item All elements of $V$ are included in $\tilde{K}$.

		\item If $\sigma^{(d)}$ is a subset of $\tilde{K}$ and $\tau^{(k)}$ is a subset
			of $\sigma^{(d)}$, then $\tau^{(k)}$ is also a subset of $\tilde{K}$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

The abstract simplicial complex $\tilde{K}$ associated with a simplicial complex
$K$ is commonly referred to as its vertex scheme. Conversely, if an abstract
complex $\tilde{K}$ serves as the vertex scheme for a complex $K$ in
$\mathbb{R}^{n}$, then $K$ is known as a geometric realization of $\tilde{K}$.

\begin{proposition}
	Every finite abstract simplicial complex $\tilde{K}$ can be realized geometrically
	in an Euclidean space.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	Let $\{v_{1},v_{2}, \ldots, v_{n}\}$ denote the vertex set of $\tilde{K}$,
	where $n$ represents the number of vertices in $\tilde{K}$. Consider $\sigma^{(n-1)}
	\subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$, the simplex formed by the span of
	$\{e_{1}, e_{2}, \ldots, e_{n}\}$, where $e_{i}$ represents the $i$th unit
	vector. In this context, $K$ refers to the subcomplex of $\sigma^{(d)}$ such
	that $[e_{i_0}, \ldots, e_{i_d}]$ is a $d$-simplex of $K$ if and only if
	$[v_{i_0}, \ldots, v_{i_d}]$ is a simplex of $\tilde{K}$.
\end{proof}

All realizations of an abstract simplicial complex are homeomorphic to each other.
The specific realization mentioned above is referred to as the natural
realization.

\begin{proposition}
	Let $\tilde{K}$ be an abstract simplicial complex. Then any two geometric
	realizations $|\tilde{K}|_{1}$ and $|\tilde{K}|_{2}$ of $\tilde{K}$ are
	homeomorphic.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	Consider two geometric realizations $|\tilde{K}|_{1}$ and $|\tilde{K}|_{2}$ of
	the abstract simplicial complex $\tilde{K}$. Each realization
	$|\tilde{K}|_{i}$ is constructed by mapping the vertices of $\tilde{K}$ to
	points in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and by identifying each simplex in $\tilde{K}$ with
	the convex hull of its image under this mapping. By construction, each simplex
	in $|\tilde{K}|_{i}$ corresponds homeomorphically to a standard $k$-simplex in
	$\mathbb{R}^{k}$ for the appropriate $k$.

	To establish a homeomorphism between $|\tilde{K}|_{1}$ and $|\tilde{K}|_{2}$,
	define a map $f: |\tilde{K}|_{1} \to |\tilde{K}|_{2}$ that acts on each vertex
	$v$ of $\tilde{K}$ by mapping it from its image in $|\tilde{K}|_{1}$ to its
	image in $|\tilde{K}|_{2}$. Extend $f$ linearly to act on each simplex in $|\tilde
	{K}|_{1}$, where a simplex is represented as a convex combination of the
	images of its vertices. Given the two geometric realizations $|\tilde{K}|_{1}$
	and $|\tilde{K}|_{2}$ of $\tilde{K}$, where vertices $v_{i}$ in
	$|\tilde{K}|_{1}$ are mapped to points $p_{i}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and in
	$|\tilde{K}|_{2}$ to points $q_{i}$, the map $f : |\tilde{K}|_{1} \to |\tilde{K}
	|_{2}$ is defined such that for each vertex $v_{i}$ corresponding to $p_{i}$ in
	$|\tilde{K}|_{1}$, we set $f(p_{i}) = q_{i}$. This map is linearly extended across
	each simplex in $|\tilde{K}|_{1}$. Specifically, for a point $x$ within a simplex
	of $|\tilde{K}|_{1}$, expressed as a convex combination
	$x = \sum_{j=1}^{k} \lambda_{j} p_{i_j}$, where $\{v_{i_1}, v_{i_2}, \ldots, v_{i_k}
	\}$ denote the vertices of the simplex and $\lambda_{j} \geq 0$ with $\sum_{j=1}
	^{k} \lambda_{j} = 1$, the function $f$ is defined by
	$f(x) = \sum_{j=1}^{k} \lambda_{j} q_{i_j}$. This formulation ensures that $f$
	is a continuous and bijective map, preserving the simplicial structure and
	thereby establishing $f$ as a homeomorphism between $|\tilde{K}|_{1}$ and
	$|\tilde{K}|_{2}$.

	The map $f$ is continuous on each simplex because it represents a linear
	transformation on compact convex subsets in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Since both $|\tilde
	{K}|_{1}$ and $|\tilde{K}|_{2}$ are topologized by the quotient of their respective
	disjoint unions of simplices under an equivalence relation that glues them along
	common faces, and since $f$ preserves these gluing conditions, $f$ is continuous
	globally. Each simplex and its face structure in $|\tilde{K}|_{1}$ maps
	uniquely onto a corresponding simplex and face structure in $|\tilde{K}|_{2}$,
	rendering $f$ bijective. Similarly, the inverse map $g: |\tilde{K}|_{2} \to |\tilde
	{K}|_{1}$ can be constructed by reversing the roles of $|\tilde{K}|_{1}$ and $|
	\tilde{K}|_{2}$. It also maintains continuity for analogous reasons to $f$.
\end{proof}

Furthermore, it has been proven that any finite abstract simplicial complex of dimension
$d$ can be realized as a simplicial complex in $\mathbb{R}^{2d+1}$.

\begin{theorem}
	Any finite abstract simplicial complex of dimension $d$ can be realized as a simplicial
	complex in $\mathbb{R}^{2d+1}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	Let $K$ be a finite simplicial complex of dimension $d$. We construct an
	injective geometric realization $f: \tilde{K}\to \mathbb{R}^{2d+1}$ where
	$\tilde{K}$ denotes the abstract simplicial complex associated with $K$.

	Define an injective map $\tilde{f}: V(K) \to \mathbb{R}^{2d+1}$ for the vertex
	set $V(K)$ of $K$. Since $V(K)$ is finite and $\mathbb{R}^{2d+1}$ has sufficient
	dimensionality, injectivity is guaranteed. Adjust $\tilde{f}$ if necessary to ensure
	the images of the vertices of each simplex $\sigma \in K$ are affinely independent.
	This can be achieved by slight perturbations within $\mathbb{R}^{2d+1}$, leveraging
	the ample dimensionality to avoid overlaps. We extend $\tilde{f}$ to a map
	$f: \tilde{K}\to \mathbb{R}^{2d+1}$ by defining it on each simplex
	$\sigma = [v_{0}, \ldots, v_{k}]$ through the unique affine map
	$v_{i} \mapsto \tilde{f}(v_{i})$. The injective and affine properties of $\tilde
	{f}$ on vertices guarantee that $f$ is injective over each simplex and preserves
	the simplicial structure, meaning
	$f(|\sigma| \cap |\tau|) = f(|\sigma|) \cap f(|\tau|)$ for any simplices
	$\sigma, \tau \in K$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Simplicial Homology Groups}
\label{simplicialhomology} Given a set $V$ representing the vertices of a $d$-simplex
$\sigma^{(d)}$, we can establish an orientation for the simplex by selecting a
specific ordering for the vertices. If the vertex ordering differs from our chosen
order by an odd permutation, it is considered reversed, while even permutations are
said to preserve the orientation. Consequently, any simplex can have only two possible
orientations. Moreover, the orientation of a $d$-simplex induces an orientation on
its $(d-1)$-faces. To be more precise, if $\sigma^{(d)}:= (v_{0}, v_{1}, \ldots,
v_{d})$ represents an oriented $d$-simplex, then the orientation of the $(d-1)$-face
$\tau^{(d-1)}$ of $\sigma^{(d)}$ with the vertex set
$\{v_{0},\ldots,v_{i-1},v_{i+1},\ldots,v_{d}\}$ is given by
$\tau_{i}^{(d-1)}= (-1)^{i} (v_{0}, \ldots,v_{i-1},v_{i+1},\ldots,v_{d})$.

\begin{definition}
	{($d$-Chain) \cite[ยง2.3]{zomorodian2004computing}} \label{d-chain} Given a set
	$\{\sigma_{1}^{(d)}, \ldots, \sigma_{k}^{(d)}\}$ of arbitrarily oriented $d$-simplices
	of a complex $K$ and an abelian group $G$, we define a $d$-chain $c$ with
	coefficients $g_{i} \in G$ as a formal sum.
	\begin{equation}
		c := g_{1} \sigma^{(d)}_{1} + g_{2} \sigma^{(d)}_{2} + \ldots + g_{k} \sigma^{(d)}
		_{k} = \sum_{i=1}^{k}g_{i} \sigma^{(d)}_{i}.
	\end{equation}
\end{definition}

Henceforth we will assume that $G = (\mathbb{Z},+)$.

\begin{lemma}
	The set of simplicial $d$-chains $C^{\Delta}_{d}$ is an abelian group $(C^{\Delta}
	_{d},+)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	The identity element of the group is represented by the empty chain $\sum_{i
	\in \emptyset}$ $g_{i} \sigma^{d}_{i}$ $= e_{C_d^\Delta}= e_{G} = 0$.

	The sum of two chains is defined as $c+c' = \sum_{i=1}^{k}g_{i} \sigma_{i}^{(d)}$
	$+ \sum_{j=1}^{l}g'_{j} \sigma_{j}^{(d)}$ $=$ $\sum_{i=1}^{k}(g_{i}+g_{i}') \sigma
	_{i}^{(d)}$ $+$ $\sum_{j=k+1}^{l}g'_{j} \sigma_{j}^{(d)}$ if $k \leq l$ and $c+
	c' = \sum_{i=1}^{k}g_{i} \sigma_{i}^{(d)}+ \sum_{j=1}^{l}g'_{j} \sigma_{j}^{(d)}
	= \sum_{i=1}^{l}(g_{i}+g_{i}') \sigma_{i}^{(d)}+ \sum_{j=l+1}^{k}g_{j} \sigma_{j}
	^{(d)}$ if $k > l$, thus, we can conclude that $c+c' \in C^{\Delta}_{d}$.

	The associativity of the group operation in $C^{\Delta}_{d}$ follows directly from
	the associativity of the group operation in $G$.

	The inverse element is defined by $e_{C^\Delta_d}= c + (-c) = \sum_{i=1}^{k}g_{i}
	\sigma_{i}^{(d)}+ \sum_{i=1}^{k}(-g_{i}) \sigma_{i}^{(d)}= \sum_{i=1}^{k}(g_{i}
	-g_{i}) \sigma_{i}^{(d)}$ with $c,-c \in C^{\Delta}_{d}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
	{(Boundary) \cite[p.106]{hatcher2005algebraic}} Let $\sigma^{(d)}$ be an oriented
	$d$-simplex in a complex $K$. The boundary of $\sigma^{(d)}$ is defined as the
	simplicial $(d-1)$-chain of $K$ with coefficients in the abelian group
	$g_{i} \in G$, given by
	\begin{equation}
		\partial(\sigma^{(d)}) = g_{0} \sigma^{(d-1)}_{0} + g_{1} \sigma^{(d-1)}_{1}
		+ \ldots + g_{d} \sigma^{(d-1)}_{d} = \sum_{i=1}^{d}g_{i} \sigma^{(d-1)}_{i}
	\end{equation}
	where $\sigma^{(d-1)}_{i}$ is an $(d-1)$-face of $\sigma^{(d)}$. If $d=0$, we define
	$\partial(\sigma^{(0)}) = e_{G} = 0$.
\end{definition}

In the following, we will set $G = \mathbb{Z}$. Since $\sigma^{(d)}$ is an oriented
simplex, the $\sigma^{(d-1)}_{i}$-faces also have associated orientations. We can
extend the definition of the boundary linearly to elements of $C^{\Delta}_{d}$.

\begin{lemma}
	The \textbf{boundary operator} is a group homomorphism
	\[
		\partial: C^{\Delta}_{d} \rightarrow C^{\Delta}_{d-1}.
	\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	We define the boundary operator for a $d$-chain $c = \sum_{i=1}^{k}g_{i} \sigma
	_{i}^{(d)}$ as follows: $\partial(c) = \sum_{i=1}^{k}g_{i}$
	$\partial(\sigma_{i}^{(d)})$ $=$
	$\sum_{i=1}^{k}g_{i} \sum_{j=1}^{d}\sigma_{j}^{(d-1)}$ $=$
	$\sum_{i=1}^{k}\sum_{j=1}^{d}g_{i} \sigma_{j}^{(d-1)}$ which is an element of
	$C^{\Delta}_{d-1}$, where $\sigma_{i}^{(d)}$ are the $d$-simplices of $K$.

	We can compute this by
	\begin{align}
		\partial(c + c') & = \partial(\sum_{i=1}^{k}g_{i} \sigma_{i}^{(d)}+ \sum_{j=1}^{l}g'_{j} \sigma_{j}^{(d)})            \\
		                 & = \sum_{i=1}^{k}g_{i} \partial(\sigma_{i}^{(d)}) + \sum_{j=1}^{l}g'_{j} \partial(\sigma_{j}^{(d)}) \\
		                 & = \partial(c) + \partial(c').
	\end{align}
\end{proof}

\begin{example}
	Let's consider the $2$-simplex $\sigma^{(2)}$ with vertices $v_{0}$, $v_{1}$, and
	$v_{2}$. The $1$-faces of this simplex are $e_{0} = (v_{1},v_{2})$ connecting
	$v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$, $e_{1} = (v_{2},v_{0})$ connecting $v_{2}$ and $v_{0}$,
	and $e_{2} = (v_{0},v_{1})$ connecting $v_{0}$ and $v_{1}$. Now, let's proceed
	with the computation.
	\begin{align}
		\partial(\partial(\sigma^{(2)})) & = \partial (e_{0}+e_{1}+e_{2})                                          \\
		                                 & = \partial(e_{0}) + \partial(e_{1}) + \partial(e_{2})                   \\
		                                 & = \partial(v_{1},v_{2}) + \partial(v_{2},v_{0}) + \partial(v_{0},v_{1}) \\
		                                 & = [(v_{2})-(v_{1})] + [(v_{0})-(v_{2})]+[(v_{1})-(v_{0})].
	\end{align}
	We observe that $C^{\Delta}_{0}$ is an abelian group and that oppositely oriented
	simplices cancel each other out, resulting in
	$\partial(\partial(\sigma^{(2)})) = 0$. This property can be generalized to higher
	dimensions through induction. Therefore, since $\partial$ is a linear operator
	and the chain $c$ is a sum of $d$-simplices, we can conclude that
	$\partial^{2}(c) = 0$ for any $d$-chain $c$ in $C^{\Delta}_{d}$. Consequently,
	the boundary of the boundary is zero. Moreover, if the boundary of a simplex
	is zero, it is referred to as a cycle. By this definition, we can deduce that the
	boundary of any simplex is a cycle.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
	{(Cycles) \cite[p.106]{hatcher2005algebraic}} A $d$-chain is a cycle if its boundary
	is equal to zero.
\end{definition}

We denote the set of $d$-cycles of a complex $K$ over the group $\mathbb{Z}$ as
$Z^{\Delta}_{d}$, the simplicial cycle group. It is important to note that
$Z^{\Delta}_{d}$ is a subgroup of $C^{\Delta}_{d}$ and can also be expressed as
$Z^{\Delta}_{d} = \ker(\partial_{d})$.

A $d$-cycle of a $k$-complex $K$ is said to be homologous to zero if it can be
expressed as the boundary of an $(d+1)$-chain in $K$, where $d=0,1,\ldots,k-1$.
In other words, a cycle is considered a boundary if it can be "filled in" by a higher-dimensional
chain. This equivalence relation is denoted as $c \sim 0$.

\begin{definition}
	{(Boundary Group) \cite[ยง2.3]{zomorodian2004computing}} The subgroup of $Z^{\Delta}
	_{d}$ consisting of boundaries is referred to as the simplicial boundary group
	$B^{\Delta}_{d}$.
\end{definition}

It is worth noting that $B^{\Delta}_{d}$ is equal to the image of the boundary operator
$\partial_{d+1}$. Since $B^{\Delta}_{d}$ is a subgroup of $Z^{\Delta}_{d}$ and
$Z^{\Delta}_{d}$ is an abelian group, every subgroup of $Z^{\Delta}_{d}$ is normal.
Therefore, we can construct the group quotient $H^{\Delta}_{d} = Z^{\Delta}_{d} /
B^{\Delta}_{d}$.

\begin{definition}
	{(Simplicial Homology Group) \cite[ยง2.1]{hatcher2005algebraic}} The group $H^{\Delta}
	_{d}$ represents the $d$-dimensional simplicial homology group of the complex $K$
	over $\mathbb{Z}$. It can be expressed as the group quotient
	$\ker(\partial_{d}) / \text{im}(\partial_{d+1})$.
\end{definition}

\section{Persistent Homology}

\section{Persistent (Co)homology}
Inverse problems primarily involve inferring geometric shapes from measurements like
path integrals. Classical methods such as Fourier transforms provide extensive
information but struggle with nonlinearity and ill-posed conditions, requiring substantial
regularization. Topology, particularly through persistent homology, offers
alternative methods for deducing topological rather than geometric information. This
approach is especially useful in high-dimensional, discrete sets of points, exemplified
in the finite case by geological sonar to detect subterranean features based on density
variations \cite[ยง1]{de2011dualities}. Persistent homology identifies
topological features represented as intervals in a barcode or persistence
diagram, crucial for understanding the presence and persistence of features such
as holes or voids in topological spaces. This method is statistically robust and
can provide both qualitative and quantitative insights into point sets, which we
suspect to lie on some compact topological object \cite{chazal2014persistence,chazal2009proximity}.

In our work, we continue to examine the consequences of absolute and relative
homology and cohomology groups for filtrations of cell complexes, such as the introduced
simplicial complexes. In particular, we derive the theory in the context of filtered
simplicial complexed upon sets of points, embedded into some metric space. While
we can apply the entire theory to simplicial complexes and their (co)homology, cell
complexes provide a much broader context and significantly simplify notation in many
instances.

In particular, there are at least four naturally arising persistent objects that
can be extracted from a filtration of any topological space. We follow the results
of de Silva, Morozov, and Vejdemo-Johansson for our explanations \cite[ยง1]{de2011dualities}.
They are

\begin{equation*}
	\text{persistent}
	\begin{Bmatrix}
		\text{absolute} \\
		\text{relative}
	\end{Bmatrix}
	\begin{Bmatrix}
		\text{homology}   \\
		\text{cohomology}
	\end{Bmatrix}.
\end{equation*}

In this work, we address the computation of barcodes for all four types of persistent
objects. We demonstrate that both absolute and relative (co)homologies yield identical
barcodes and that transitions between these states are facilitated by established
duality principles. The duality between homology and cohomology is akin to the
duality in vector spaces, whereas a global duality specific to persistent topology
allows for a unique interchange:
\begin{align*}
	\text{Absolute homology}   & \rightleftarrows \text{relative cohomology.} \\
	\text{Absolute cohomology} & \rightleftarrows \text{relative homology.}
\end{align*}

The main results from the literature suggest that a single calculation is sufficient
to compute all four persistent objects due to the commutative nature of the global
duality.

\subsection{Filtrations of Complexes}
Individual (co)homology groups are consistently defined with coefficients in a
fixed field $\mathbb{F}$, organizing persistent (co)homology as a graded module
over $\mathbb{F}[x]$, as can be seen in the next chapter \ref{}. Replacing
$\mathbb{F}$ with the ring $\mathbb{Z}$ leads to substantial issues, but most of
the results still hold for principal ideal domains, as discussed in
\cite[ยง3.1]{zomorodian2004computing}.

We investigate the persistent topology of filtered topological spaces, with a primary
focus on the prototypical example of a filtered cell complex. This structure is
defined by a sequence $\mathcal{X}$ of cell complexes:
\begin{equation*}
	\mathcal{X}: \emptyset \subset X_{1} \subset X_{2} \subset \cdots \subset X_{n}
	= X_{\infty},
\end{equation*}
where $X_{1}$ starts with a single vertex $\sigma_{1}$, and each subsequent
complex $X_{i}$ is constructed by adding a single cell to the previous complex:
\begin{equation*}
	X_{i} := X_{i-1}\cup \sigma_{i}.
\end{equation*}
Here, the indexing set is $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$. Additionally, associated real
values $a_{i}$ are assigned to these indices, satisfying $a_{1} \leq a_{2} \leq \cdots
\leq a_{n}.$ This formulation clearly delineates the stepwise enlargement of the
complex, illustrating the dynamic evolution of its topology as new cells are
incrementally incorporated. We will use the same running example as in \cite[ยง2.2]{de2011dualities}.

\begin{example}
	\label{filteredsphere} The chosen illustrative example involves a cellular filtration
	of the 2-sphere, denoted by $\mathcal{S}^{2}$. This process constructs a cell complex
	and introduces an ordering among the cells to facilitate differentiation between
	them. The development of the filtration can be articulated as follows
	\cite[ยง2.2]{de2011dualities}:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item[$\mathcal{S}^{2}:$] $\emptyset$

		\item[$\subset$] $S_{1} = \{\sigma_{1}\}$

		\item[$\subset$] $S_{2} = \{\sigma_{1}, \sigma_{2}\}$

		\item[$\subset$] $S_{3} = \{\sigma_{1}, \sigma_{2}, \sigma_{3} := (\sigma_{1}
			, \sigma_{2})\}$

		\item[$\subset$] $S_{4} = \{\sigma_{1}, \sigma_{2}, \sigma_{3}, \sigma_{4} :=
			(\sigma_{2}, \sigma_{1})\}$

		\item[$\subset$] $S_{5} = \{\sigma_{1}, \sigma_{2}, \sigma_{3}, \sigma_{4}, \sigma
			_{5} := (\sigma_{3}, \sigma_{4})\}$

		\item[$\subset$] $S_{6} = \{\sigma_{1}, \sigma_{2}, \sigma_{3}, \sigma_{4}, \sigma
			_{5}, \sigma_{6} := (\sigma_{4}, \sigma_{3})\}.$
	\end{itemize}

	In this sequence, the cell $\sigma_{1}$ symbolizes the initial point. The set $S
	_{2}$ incorporates two distinct points. In $S_{3}$, a path connecting $\sigma_{1}$
	and $\sigma_{2}$ is introduced. $S_{4}$ augments this path with its
	reverseโfrom $\sigma_{2}$ to $\sigma_{1}$โclearly distinguishing it from $\sigma
	_{3}$. Finally, $S_{5}$ and $S_{6}$ progressively differentiate between cells that
	represent the upper and lower halves of the sphere, respectively.
\end{example}

\subsection{Persistent Homology on Complexes}
In the context of algebraic topology, applying the homology functor $\mathsf{H}$
to a filtration of a complex $\mathcal{X}$ yields a sequence of algebraic structures:
\begin{equation}
	\mathsf{H}(\mathcal{X}): \quad \mathsf{H}(X_{1}) \to \mathsf{H}(X_{2}) \to \cdots
	\to \mathsf{H}(X_{n}),
\end{equation}
where $\mathsf{H}(-)$ generally represents either the $k$-th dimensional
homology, denoted by $H_{k}(-;\mathbb{F})$, or the total homology, expressed as $H
_{\bullet}(-;\mathbb{F})$. Here, this diagram characterizes a sequence of abelian
groups or finite-dimensional vector spaces, interconnected through vector space
homomorphisms, forming what is known as a persistence module.

Persistence modules are central to understanding how the features of a space evolve
over time. They can typically be decomposed into a direct sum of interval
modules (\ref{intervaldecomposition}). Each interval module is associated with an
ordered pair of integers $(p,q)$ where $1 \leq p \leq q \leq n$, within a finite
filtration. These pairs $(p,q)$ signify topological features that persist over an
index set $I := \{p, \ldots, q\}$, where $\inf\{I\} = p$ and $\sup\{I\} = q$. Conventionally,
these tuples are interpreted as half-open intervals $[a_{p}, a_{q+1})$, with $a_{n+1}
= \infty$ being a customary notation when the sequence extends beyond the largest
indexed space.

The decomposition of a persistence module into its constituent interval modules is
represented in a persistence diagram (\ref{persistencediagrams}), or a barcode (\ref{persistencebarcodes}).
This barcode is a multiset of ordered tuples $(p,q)$ or, alternatively, a multiset
of half-open intervals $[a_{p}, a_{q+1})$. This collection is formally expressed
through the forgetful functor $\textbf{Pers}(-)$:
\begin{align}
	\textbf{Pers}(\mathsf{H}(\mathcal{X})) & = \{(p_{1},q_{1}), \ldots, (p_{m},q_{m})\}                    \\
	                                       & \cong \{[a_{p_1}, a_{q_1+1}), \ldots, [a_{p_m}, a_{q_m+1})\}.
\end{align}
In practical applications, intervals where $a_{p} = a_{q+1}$ are usually omitted,
as they represent ephemeral topological features.

\begin{example}
	In the further elaboration of the example previously cited, which is also
	described in \ref{filteredsphere}, we consider the topological subspaces $S_{1}
	, S_{3}, S_{5}$, all of which are contractible. Meanwhile,
	$S_{2}, S_{4}, S_{6}$ are homeomorphic to the $0$-sphere, $1$-sphere, and $2$-sphere,
	respectively. This structural distinction leads to four distinct intervals in
	the persistence diagram of the total homology of a sphere, specifically $\mathcal{S}
	^{2}$:
	\begin{align}
		\textbf{Pers}(H_{\bullet}(\mathcal{S}^{2})) & = \{(1,6)_{0}, (2,2)_{0}, (4,4)_{1}, (6,6)_{2} \}             \\
		                                            & = \{(1,\infty)_{0}, (2,3)_{0}, (4,5)_{1}, (6, \infty)_{2} \}.
	\end{align}
	Here, the subscript $k$ in $(p,q)_{k}$ or $[a_{p}, a_{q+1})_{k}$ denotes a topological
	feature in the $k$-dimensional homology.
\end{example}

\subsection{The Four Standard Persistence Modules}
\label{standardpersistencemodules} The standard module of persistent homology, $H
_{\bullet}(\mathcal{X})$, illustrates how the absolute homology groups
$H_{\bullet}(X_{i})$ relate to each other as the index $i$ changes. Similar observations
can be made by considering the absolute cohomology groups $H^{\bullet}(X_{i})$,
the relative homology groups $H_{\bullet}(X_{n}, X_{i})$, and the relative cohomology
groups $H^{\bullet}(X_{n}, X_{i})$ \cite[ยง2.4]{de2011dualities}.

The persistence diagram for absolute cohomology is represented as a multiset of integer
pairs $(p,q)$, where $1 \leq p \leq q \leq n$ for a finite filtration. For relative
homology and cohomology, the persistence diagram consists of a multiset of
tuples $(p,q)$ where $0 \leq p \leq q \leq n-1$ for a finite filtration. In each
case, we interpret $(p,q)$ as a half-open interval $[a_{p}, a_{q+1})$ with the
convention that $a_{0} = -\infty$ and $a_{n+1}= \infty$
\cite[ยง2.4]{de2011dualities}.

\begin{figure}
	\begin{align*}
		H_{\bullet}(\mathcal{X})             & : \quad H_{\bullet}(X_{1}) \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow H_{\bullet}(X_{n-1}) \rightarrow H_{\bullet}(X_{n}),             \\
		H^{\bullet}(\mathcal{X})             & : \quad H^{\bullet}(X_{1}) \leftarrow \cdots \leftarrow H^{\bullet}(X_{n-1}) \leftarrow H^{\bullet}(X_{n}),                \\
		H_{\bullet}(X_{\infty}, \mathcal{X}) & : \quad H_{\bullet}(X_{n}) \rightarrow H_{\bullet}(X_{n},X_{1}) \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow H_{\bullet}(X_{n},X_{n-1}), \\
		H^{\bullet}(H_{\infty}, \mathcal{X}) & : \quad H^{\bullet}(X_{n}) \leftarrow H^{\bullet}(X_{n},X_{1}) \leftarrow \cdots \leftarrow H^{\bullet}(X_{n}, X_{n-1}).
	\end{align*}
	\caption{The four standard persistence modules.}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}
	For $\mathcal{S}^{2}$ we yield
	\begin{align}
		\textbf{Pers}(H_{\bullet}(S_{6},\mathcal{S}^{2}) & = \{(0,0)_{0}, (2,2)_{1}, (4,4)_{2}, (0,5)_{2}\}               \\
		                                                 & = \{[-\infty, 1)_{0}, [2,3)_{1}, [4,5)_{2}, [-\infty,6)_{3}\}.
	\end{align}
	At index $2$ there is a nontrivial element of $H_{1}(S_{6},S_{2})$ represented
	by any arc connecting the two points of $S_{2}$ \cite[ยง2.4]{de2011dualities} --
	the homology class is $[\sigma_{3}] = [\sigma_{4}]$. This class vanishes in $H_{1}
	(S_{6},S_{3})$, thus we yield the interval $[2,3)$.
\end{example}

\subsection{Barcode Isomorphisms}
We characterise the multisets for persistence modules that are decomposable into
interval modules. The persistence diagram partitions into $\textbf{Pers}_{0}$,
comprising finite intervals $[a, b)$ as per \cite[ยง2.3]{de2011dualities}, and $\textbf
{Pers}_{\infty}$, consisting of intervals $[a, \infty)$. This leads to the decomposition
$\textbf{Pers}= \textbf{Pers}_{0} \cup \textbf{Pers}_{\infty}$.

In this chapter, we establish that persistent homology and cohomology yield the
same intervals, or barcodes, for both absolute and relative (co-)homology
frameworks. This equivalence necessitates invoking the universal coefficient theorem
from algebraic topology, which we will proof beforehand. The universal coefficient
theorem for cohomology elegantly ties together the cohomology of a space with coefficients
in any abelian group $G$ to the homology of the space with integer coefficients.
Specifically, as notation for this proof, $H_{n}(X;\mathbb{Z})$ and
$H^{n}(X;\mathbb{Z})$ denote the $n$-th singular homology and cohomology groups
with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}$, respectively. We further involve
$\text{Hom}(A, G)$, denoting group homomorphisms from an abelian group $A$ to another
abelian group $G$, and $\text{Ext}^{1}(A, G)$ \cite{}, which measures obstructions
in the splitting of a short exact sequence of abelian groups. Further, we use the
properties of derived functors \cite{}.

\begin{theorem}
	{(Universal Coefficient Theorem for Cohomology) \cite[ยง3.1]{hatcher2005algebraic}}
	\label{universalcoefficients} Let $X$ be a topological space and $G$ be an abelian
	group. For any integer $n \geq 0$, there is a short exact sequence:
	\begin{align*}
		0 \rightarrow \text{Ext}^{1}(H_{n-1}(X;\mathbb{Z},G) \rightarrow H^{n}(X;G) \rightarrow \text{Hom}(H_{n}(X;\mathbb{Z},G) \rightarrow 0,
	\end{align*}
	which splits, though not canonically.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	Let $C_{\bullet}(X)$ be the singular chain complex of a topological space $X$ with
	integer coefficients. The homology groups $H_{d}(X; \mathbb{Z})$ are defined
	as
	$H_{d}(X; \mathbb{Z}) := \ker(\partial_{d}) / \operatorname{im}(\partial_{d+1})$,
	where $\partial_{d}$ are the boundary maps in $C_{\bullet}(X)$. The chain
	group $C_{d}(X)$ consists of formal sums of singular $d$-simplices in $X$ with
	integer coefficients. The boundary maps $\partial_{d}: C_{d}(X) \rightarrow C_{d-1}
	(X)$ are defined by
	\[
		\partial_{d}(\sigma) = \sum_{i=0}^{d}(-1)^{i} \sigma|_{[v_0, \ldots, \hat{v}_i,
		\ldots, v_d]},
	\]
	where $\sigma: \Delta^{d} \rightarrow X$ is a singular simplex, and
	$\sigma|_{[v_0, \ldots, \hat{v}_i, \ldots, v_d]}$ denotes the restriction of
	$\sigma$ to the $i$-th face of the simplex, omitting the $i$-th vertex.

	The functor $\operatorname{Hom}(-, G)$ applied to $C_{d}(X)$ yields a group $\operatorname{Hom}
	(C_{d}(X), G)$, and the coboundary $\delta^{d}$ for the cochain complex
	$\operatorname{Hom}(C_{\bullet}(X), G)$ is defined by
	\[
		\delta^{d}(f) = f \circ \partial_{d+1}
	\]
	for $f$ in $\operatorname{Hom}(C_{d+1}(X), G)$. This leads to the cohomology groups
	$H^{d}(X; G) = \ker(\delta^{d}) / \operatorname{im}(\delta^{d-1})$. We
	consider the projective resolution of $C_{\bullet}(X)$ to effectively apply
	the $\operatorname{Ext}$ functor. Recall that for any abelian group $A$,
	\[
		\operatorname{Ext}^{1}(A, G) = R^{1} \operatorname{Hom}(A, G),
	\]
	where $R^{1}$ denotes the first right derived functor of $\operatorname{Hom}$.
	To show this equality, we begin by taking a projective resolution of $A$:
	\[
		\cdots \to P_{2} \to P_{1} \to P_{0} \to A \to 0,
	\]
	where each $P_{i}$ is a projective abelian group. Then we can apply the
	functor $\operatorname{Hom}(-, G)$ to the projective resolution:
	\[
		0 \to \operatorname{Hom}(P_{0}, G) \to \operatorname{Hom}(P_{1}, G) \to \operatorname{Hom}
		(P_{2}, G) \to \cdots.
	\]
	This sequence is exact on the left because $\operatorname{Hom}(-, G)$ is left exact
	and each $P_{i}$ is projective. The first right derived functor
	$R^{1}\operatorname{Hom}(A, G)$ is defined as the cohomology of this sequence
	at the location corresponding to $P_{1}$:
	\[
		R^{1} \operatorname{Hom}(A, G) = \frac{\ker(\operatorname{Hom}(P_{1}, G) \to
		\operatorname{Hom}(P_{2}, G))}{\operatorname{im}(\operatorname{Hom}(P_{0}, G)
		\to \operatorname{Hom}(P_{1}, G))}.
	\]
	The group $\operatorname{Ext}^{1}(A, G)$ classifies extensions of $A$ by $G$,
	equivalent to the kernel/image calculation in the cohomology of the
	$\text{Hom}$-sequence, confirming
	\[
		\operatorname{Ext}^{1}(A, G) = R^{1} \operatorname{Hom}(A, G).
	\]

	Given $H_{d}(X; \mathbb{Z})$, consider the short exact sequence obtained from the
	projective resolution of $\mathbb{Z}$:
	\[
		0 \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}\rightarrow F \rightarrow H_{d}(X; \mathbb{Z}) \rightarrow
		0,
	\]
	where $F$ is free. Applying $\operatorname{Hom}(-, G)$ gives
	\[
		0 \rightarrow \operatorname{Hom}(H_{d}(X; \mathbb{Z}), G) \rightarrow \operatorname{Hom}
		(F, G) \rightarrow \operatorname{Hom}(\mathbb{Z}, G) \rightarrow \operatorname{Ext}
		^{1}(H_{d}(X; \mathbb{Z}), G) \rightarrow 0.
	\]
	We apply $\operatorname{Ext}^{\bullet}$, which gives rise to the long exact
	sequence of $\operatorname{Ext}$ groups:
	\[
		0 \rightarrow \operatorname{Hom}(H_{d}(X; \mathbb{Z}), G) \rightarrow H^{d}(X
		; G) \rightarrow \operatorname{Ext}^{1}(H_{d-1}(X; \mathbb{Z}), G) \rightarrow
		0.
	\]
	Finally, we verify exactness and splitting. The term $\operatorname{Ext}^{1}(H_{d-1}
	(X; \mathbb{Z}), G)$ measures the non-trivial extensions of $G$ by $H_{d-1}(X;
	\mathbb{Z})$, which corresponds to the obstructions to lifting
	$H_{d-1}(X; \mathbb{Z})$ linearly over $G$. The term $\operatorname{Hom}(H_{d}(
	X; \mathbb{Z}), G)$ represents the group homomorphisms from $H_{d}(X; \mathbb{Z}
	)$ to $G$, which naturally includes in $H^{d}(X; G)$. The sequence is exact at
	each stage by the properties of derived functors and their application to the singular
	chain complex. The sequence ends with $0$ because $\operatorname{Ext}^{1}$ of
	a projective (or free) module vanishes, and $\mathbb{Z}$ is free. The sequence
	splits because the functor $\operatorname{Hom}(-, G)$ preserves products and
	coproducts. However, the way it splits is not canonical and depends on the
	choice of a splitting homomorphism, which is not unique.

	In the generalization of the universal coefficient theorem to the case of modules
	over a principal ideal domain, the $\text{Ext}^{1}$ terms vanish since $\F$ is
	a field, so we obtain isomorphisms $H^{d}(X;\F) \cong \Hom(H_{d}(X;\F),\F)$ \cite[p.198
	ยง3.3.1]{hatcher2005algebraic}.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
	For all integers $d \geq 0$ it holds that \cite[ยง2.3]{de2011dualities}:
	\begin{align*}
		\textbf{Pers}(H_{d}(\mathcal{X}) = \textbf{Pers}(H^{d}(\mathcal{X}),                         \\
		\textbf{Pers}(H_{d}(X_{\infty}, \mathcal{X}) = \textbf{Pers}(H^{d}(X_{\infty}, \mathcal{X}).
	\end{align*}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	When we consider coefficients in a field rather than in a ring, the universal
	coefficient theorem assures us of a natural isomorphism between the $d$-th
	cohomology group and the homomorphisms from the $d$-th homology group to the
	base field:
	\begin{equation}
		H^{d}(X;\mathbb{F}) \cong \text{Hom}(H_{d}(X;\mathbb{F}),\mathbb{F}).
	\end{equation}
	Therefore, the associated maps
	\begin{equation}
		H_{d}(X_{i};\mathbb{F}) \rightarrow H_{d}(X_{j};\mathbb{F}) \quad \text{and}\quad
		H^{d}(X_{i};\mathbb{F}) \leftarrow H^{d}(X_{j};\mathbb{F})
	\end{equation}
	are adjoint and hence possess the same rank. Since the persistence intervals over
	a field are uniquely determined by the dimension and rank of the homology vector
	spaces, it follows that this holds for both homology and cohomology. Consequently,
	they share the same barcode.
\end{proof}

Consider a filtration $X_{1} \subseteq X_{2} \subseteq \cdots \subseteq X_{n}$ of
a topological space $X$, extending to $X_{\infty}$ where $X_{\infty}$ is the
direct limit of the filtration. The homology groups $H_{d}(X_{n})$ for some fixed
dimension $d$ serve as the initial terms for the relative homology groups $H_{d}(
X_{\infty}, X)$. Since $H_{d}(X)$ is consistent with $H_{d}(X_{n})$ as $n$
approaches infinity, these sequences can be unified into a single sequence:
$H_{d}(X) \to H_{d}(X_{\infty}, X)$. For this concatenated sequence, the indices
are denoted as
$\{1, 2, \ldots, n = 0^{\flat}, 1^{\flat}, 2^{\flat}, \ldots, (n-1)^{\flat}\}$, using
the $\flat$ symbol to indicate terms in the relative homology part of the sequence.

This structure allows us to discuss the persistence diagram associated with this
homological configuration. The persistence intervals in this diagram can
generally be categorized into three types:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Intervals of the form $(p, q)$ where $1 \leq p \leq q < n$, denoted as
		$[p, q+1)$ or $[a_{p}, a_{q+1})$.

	\item Intervals of the form $(p^{\flat}, q^{\flat})$ where $0 < p \leq q \leq n
		-1$, denoted as $[p^{\flat}, q^{\flat}+1)$ or $[a_{p^\flat}, a_{q^\flat+1})$.

	\item Intervals of the form $(p, q^{\flat})$ where $1 \leq p \leq n$ and $0 \leq
		q \leq n-1$, represented as $[p, q^{\flat}+1)$ or $[a_{p}, a_{q^\flat+1})$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{corollary}
	The barcode $\textbf{Pers}(H_{d}(\X) \rightarrow H_{d}(X_{\infty}, \X)$ comprises
	the following collections of intervals \cite[ยง2.5]{de2011dualities}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item An interval $[a,b)$ for every interval $[a,b)$ in $\textbf{Pers}_{0}(H_{d}
			(\X))$.

		\item An interval $[a^{\flat}, b^{\flat})$ for every interval $[a,b)$ in $\textbf
			{Pers}_{0}(H_{d-1}(\X))$.

		\item An interval $[a,a^{\flat})$ for every interval $[a,\infty)$ in $\textbf
			{Pers}_{\infty}(H_{d}(\X))$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
	We begin by analyzing the first two types of intervals in the persistence diagram
	$\textbf{Pers}(H_{d}(X) \to H_{d}(X_{\infty}, X))$. These intervals either do
	not intersect the intermediate term $H_{d}(X_{n})$ or terminate before it. Consequently,
	they correspond precisely to the finite intervals in $\textbf{Pers}(H_{d}(X))$
	and $\textbf{Pers}(H_{d}(X_{\infty}, X))$, clarifying the first two cases. The
	correspondence
	$\textbf{Pers}_{0}(H_{d}(X_{\infty}, X)) = \textbf{Pers}_{0}(H_{d-1}(X))$
	helps in mapping these relationships.

	The third case requires examining intervals of the form $[a, b^{\flat})$ and
	proving that they are invariably of the form $[a, a^{\flat})$, which means that
	the paired intervals $[a,\infty)$ and $[-\infty,a)$ in $\textbf{Pers}_{\infty}(
	H_{d}(\X))$ and $\textbf{Pers}_{\infty}(H_{d}(X_{\infty}, \X))$ are restrictions
	of a single interval $[a,a^{\flat})$ in the concatenated sequence \cite[p.6]{de2011dualities}.
	To establish this, we compare the ascending filtration defined by the images of
	$H_{d}(X_{i})$ in $H_{d}(X_{n})$ for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n-1$ (denoted as
	$\text{Im}(H_{d}(X_{i}) \to H_{d}(X_{n}))$) with the descending filtration defined
	by the kernels of $H_{d}(X_{n})$ in $H_{d}(X_{\infty}, X)$ for $i = 1, 2, \ldots
	, n-1$ (denoted as $\text{Ker}(H_{d}(X_{n}) \to H_{d}(X_{n}, X_{i}))$). This
	examination revolves around the fundamental properties of the homology groups
	in a filtration setting.

	For each index $i$, the image and kernel correspond to the same subspace of $H_{d}
	(X_{n})$. This equivalence is guaranteed by the homology long exact sequence
	associated with the pair $(X_{n}, X_{i})$, which links the relative and absolute
	homology groups. Specifically, the exact sequence implies that any cycle in $\text{Im}
	(H_{d}(X_{i}) \to H_{d}(X_{n}))$ that becomes a boundary in $H_{d}(X_{n}, X_{i}
	)$ must vanish, thus equating the image and kernel. As a result, both
	filtrations align perfectly, establishing that the third type of interval indeed
	maps to self-closing intervals of the form $[a, a^{\flat})$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Persistent Chain Complexes}
Alternatively, following \cite[ยง2.6]{de2011dualities}, the standard persistence module
can be described via a filtered cell complex $\mathcal{X}:= \sigma_{1} \cup \cdots
\cup \sigma_{d}$, so that the persistence module can be expressed as the
sequence
\[
	\mathcal{C}: \quad C_{1} \to C_{2} \to \cdots \to C_{d},
\]
for a finite filtration, where each $C_{i} := \langle \sigma_{1}, \ldots, \sigma_{i}
\rangle$ is a vector space (or an abelian group) over a field $\mathbb{F}$,
generated by the elements $\sigma_{1}, \ldots, \sigma_{i}$. The boundary operator
is defined by $\partial \sigma_{j} = \sum_{i<j}\lambda_{ij}\sigma_{i}$ for $\lambda
_{ij}\in \mathbb{F}$ for all $i, j \in \{1, \ldots, d\}$.

Then $C_{\bullet}(X_{i}) = (C_{i},\partial_{i})$ is the chain complex for the absolute
homology of $X_{i}$, and $C_{\bullet}(\mathcal{X}) = (\mathcal{C},\partial)$
represents the persistent version for $\mathcal{X}$. This leads to the definition
of the persistent absolute homology of $\mathcal{X}$ as
\[
	H_{\bullet}(\mathcal{X}) = H(\mathcal{C}, \partial): \quad \frac{\ker(\partial_{1})}{\text{im}(\partial_{1})}
	\to \frac{\ker(\partial_{2})}{\text{im}(\partial_{2})}\to \cdots \to \frac{\ker(\partial_{d})}{\text{im}(\partial_{d})}
	.
\]

For the persistent absolute cohomology $H^{\bullet}(\mathcal{X})$, we define
\[
	\mathcal{C}^{\flat}: \quad C^{\flat}_{1} \leftarrow C^{\flat}_{2} \leftarrow \cdots
	\leftarrow C^{\flat}_{d},
\]
where $C_{i}^{\flat} = \text{Hom}(C_{i}, \mathbb{F}) = \langle \sigma_{1}^{\flat}
, \sigma_{2}^{\flat}, \ldots, \sigma_{i}^{\flat} \rangle$, with
$\{\sigma_{i}^{\flat}\}$ as the dual basis of $\{\sigma_{i}\}$. The coboundary $\delta
= \partial^{\flat}$ is defined as the adjoint of $\partial$. Then
$C^{\flat}(\mathcal{X}) = (\mathcal{C}^{\flat}, \delta)$ and
$H^{\bullet}(\mathcal{X}) = H(\mathcal{C}^{\flat}, \delta) = \ker(\delta) / \text{im}
(\delta)$. This too constitutes a persistence module, with morphisms in the
reverse direction.

\begin{example}
	For $\mathcal{S}^{2}$, the boundary operator is given by
	\begin{align}
		\partial\sigma_{1} & = \partial\sigma_{2} = 0,                       \\
		\partial\sigma_{3} & = \partial\sigma_{4} = \sigma_{1}-\sigma_{2},   \\
		\partial\sigma_{5} & = \partial\sigma_{6} = \sigma_{3} - \sigma_{4}.
	\end{align}
	This information can also be summarized in a matrix. Similarly, the coboundary
	operator is given by
	\begin{align}
		\delta\sigma_{1}^{\flat} = -\delta\sigma_{2}^{\flat} & = \sigma_{3}^{\flat} + \sigma_{4}^{\flat}, \\
		\delta\sigma_{3}^{\flat} = -\delta\sigma_{4}^{\flat} & = \sigma_{5}^{\flat} + \sigma_{6}^{\flat}, \\
		\delta\sigma_{5}^{\flat} = \delta\sigma_{6}^{\flat}  & = 0.
	\end{align}
	This data can analogously be summarized in a transposed matrix
	\cite[p.7]{de2011dualities}.

	The relative homology and cohomology persistence modules are then defined as
	the homology of the persistence modules \cite[p.7]{de2011dualities}:
	\begin{align}
		(C_{d}/\mathcal{C}):         & \quad C_{d} \rightarrow (C_{d}/C_{1}) \rightarrow (C_{d}/C_{2}) \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow (C_{d}/C_{d-1}),                             \\
		(C_{d}/\mathcal{C})^{\flat}: & \quad C_{d}^{\flat} \leftarrow (C_{d}/C_{1})^{\flat} \leftarrow (C_{d}/C_{2})^{\flat} \leftarrow \cdots \leftarrow (C_{d}/C_{d-1})^{\flat}.
	\end{align}
	We note that the mappings $\rightarrow$ from $\mathcal{C}$ and the mappings $\leftarrow$
	from $(C_{d}/\mathcal{C})^{\flat}$ are injective, while the mappings
	$\leftarrow$ from $\mathcal{C}^{\flat}$ and the mappings $\rightarrow$ from
	$(C_{d}/\mathcal{C})$ are surjective. Thus, absolute and relative cohomology
	are structurally similar but qualitatively different from absolute homology
	and relative homology.
\end{example}

\begin{theorem}
	{(Persistence Partition) \cite[ยง2.6]{de2011dualities}} \label{persistence
	partition} Let $\mathcal{C}$ be given and $\partial$ as above, then there
	exists a partition
	\begin{align*}
		\{1,2, \ldots, d\} = P^{\Join} \sqcup P \sqcup N
	\end{align*}
	with a bijective pairing $P \leftrightarrow N$, such that
	\begin{align}
		p \text{ is paired with }n \; \iff [p,n) \in \textbf{Pairs}(\mathcal{C}, \partial).
	\end{align}
	Furthermore, there is a basis
	$\hat{\sigma}_{1}, \hat{\sigma}_{2}, \ldots, \hat{\sigma}_{d}$ of $C_{d}$ such
	that
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $C_{i} = \langle \hat{\sigma}_{1}, \ldots, \hat{\sigma}_{i} \rangle$ for
			each $i$.

		\item $\partial\hat{\sigma}_{p} = 0$ for all $p \in P^{\Join}$.

		\item $\partial\hat{\sigma}_{n} = \hat{\sigma}_{p}$, and thus
			$\partial\hat{\sigma}_{p} = 0$, for all $[p,n) \in \textbf{Pairs}$.
	\end{enumerate}
	It follows that the persistence diagram
	$\textbf{Pers}(H(\mathcal{C},\partial))$ consists of $[a_{p}, \infty)$ for
	$p \in P^{\Join}$ together with intervals $[a_{p},a_{n})$ for
	$[p,n) \in \textbf{Pairs}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	Let $\mathcal{C}= \{C_{i}\}_{i \in I}$ be a filtered chain complex associated with
	a topological space, structured over a field $\mathbb{F}$ for any finite index
	set $I$. The filtration indices ${1, 2, \ldots, d}$, where $d = \vert I \vert$,
	classify the stages at which elements are born or die in homology. The
	partition of $\{1, 2, \ldots, d\}$ into $P^{\Join} \sqcup P \sqcup N$ is then
	constructed such that:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $P^{\Join}$ contains indices corresponding to elements that persist indefinitely,
			i.e., those for which $\partial\sigma_{i} = 0$ and $\sigma_{i}$ does not
			become a boundary at any higher index.

		\item $P$ and $N$ are paired bijectively, where each $p \in P$ (births)
			corresponds uniquely to an $n \in N$ (deaths), signifying the termination of
			the homological feature introduced at $p$. This pairing is determined
			through the matrix reduction of $\partial$, ensuring that every cycle born
			at stage $p$ becomes a boundary at stage $n$.
	\end{itemize}

	We then construct a basis ${\hat{\sigma}_i}$ such that for each $i$, $\hat{\sigma}
	_{i}$ is a generator of $C_{i}$. Specifically, if $i \in P^{\Join}$, then
	$\partial\hat{\sigma}_{i} = 0$, indicating these elements are cycles that persist
	indefinitely. For pairs $[p, n) \in \textbf{Pairs}(\mathcal{C}, \partial)$
	with $p \in P$ and $n \in N$, set $\partial\hat{\sigma}_{n} = \hat{\sigma}_{p}$
	and $\partial\hat{\sigma}_{p} = 0$, reflecting the fact that the cycle
	$\hat{\sigma}_{p}$ born at $p$ becomes a boundary at $n$ and thus ceases to
	contribute to homology past $n$.

	Hence, the persistence diagram $\textbf{Pers}(H(\mathcal{C}, \partial))$ contains
	intervals $[a_{p}, \infty)$ for each $p \in P^{\Join}$, indicating persistent
	homological features and intervals $[a_{p}, a_{n})$ for each
	$[p, n) \in \textbf{Pairs}$, describing features with finite lifespans,
	starting as a cycle at $p$ and terminating as a boundary at $n$.
\end{proof}

In \ref{persistence partition} the index sets are defined as follows \cite[p.8]{de2011dualities}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $P$ identifies the positive simplices that remain unpaired,

	\item $P^{\Join}$ identifies the positive simplices that do become paired,

	\item $N$ identifies the negative simplices.
\end{itemize}

The vectors $\hat{\sigma}_{p}$ and $\hat{\sigma}_{n}$ are cycles characterized by
their leading terms $\sigma_{p}$ and $\sigma_{n}$ respectively, while the vector
$\hat{\sigma}_{n}$ is a chain with leading term $\sigma_{n}$. This chain 'kills'
the homology class of its paired cycle $\hat{\sigma}_{p}$ through the boundary relation
$\partial \hat{\sigma}_{n} = \hat{\sigma}_{p}$.

\begin{theorem}
	For all integers $d \geq 0$ it holds that \cite[ยง2.4]{de2011dualities}:
	\begin{align*}
		\textbf{Pers}(H_{d}(\mathcal{X}) \cong \textbf{Pers}(H_{d+1}(\mathcal{X}),                       \\
		\textbf{Pers}(H_{d}(X_{\infty}, \mathcal{X}) \cong \textbf{Pers}(H_{d}(X_{\infty}, \mathcal{X}).
	\end{align*}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	Die Zerlegung
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
	In this case, we get an isomorphism of multisets. This is due to the identification
	of the intervals $[a,\infty) \leftrightarrow [-\infty, a)$ for $\textbf{Pers}_{\infty}$.
	Thus, persistent homology and relative homology barcodes carry the same information,
	with a dimension shift for the finite intervals \cite[ยง2.4]{de2011dualities}.
